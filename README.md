# Python_YTDownloader

Hi this is a working code for the Video: 3 PYTHON AUTOMATION PROJECTS, image processing. from the Youtube video by Internet Made Coder https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEQ8CXFWLZU 
This project might go for further development to make some Youtube Analyzer

Some Important notes:

1. Please know that I use python venv while doing this. There might be differences with your installed library. Although this project is straighforward, it should not cause much issue.
2. This is my own requirements.txt: requirements.txt
